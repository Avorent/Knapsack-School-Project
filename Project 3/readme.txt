[INTRO]:
Welcome! This is my third project for CS2223

[REQUIREMENTS]:
I use the IDE PyCharm Edu 4.0.2 to construct this code.
I have tried most computers and the code runs fine; so just run Knapsack.py as it is.
I use the standard Python 3.6.3 library when constructing this code and using these imports:

itertools.combinations
time.clock
tkinter.filedialog
tkinter.*
ast

[Note]: tkinter did not work when I switched to Mac OS, so I would recommend running with Windows 10.

[START]

1. Open the Knapsack.py file.

2. Proceed through the tutorial by clicking on 'Help', then trying the 3 main algorithms by clicking on them.

3. Buttons are always at the bottom. Introductory text can be seen to help guide you through this program.

Sample data sets are given and can be accessed through [LOAD] button for any of the three submenus.
I hope you enjoy using my program as much as I did when I worked on this program.
